## Problem Definition

Drag performers help foster “community and connection” in Queer spaces as artists, advocates, and community builders. Sadly mainstream social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have silenced the voices of drag artists, many are at the mercy of moderation algorithms and ever-changing rules that unfairly target LGBTQ+ members of the social network. Many drag performers have to keep backup accounts in case their main accounts are blocked by algorithms, this can cause harm in terms of breaking down community connection and also to drag artists livelihoods.
